This repository is my personal *Next.js learning folder*.  
Here, I practice and experiment with everything related to Next.js as I build my skills and understanding.

## What I Am Learning

- Understanding *routing*: automatic and dynamic
- Using *API routes* in Next.js
- Organizing *pages* and *components*
- Passing *data and props*
- Working with *images* and improving performance
- Exploring new Next.js features and updates
